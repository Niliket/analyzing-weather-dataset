### Project Overview

 We'll be working with a csv file that contains weather data for each hour in 2012. There are many interesting connections between everyday life and the weather that we will explore with the help of this dataset. Apply all the numpy and pandas skills learned so far to analyze the data. We will be using different functions of numpy and pandas library. 


### Learnings from the project

 We will learn from this project, how to wrangle and manipulate data using numpy and pandas library. Performing operations on dataframe such as groupby, pivot_table, categorizing data, conditional filtering, datetime, aggregate functions,etc.
